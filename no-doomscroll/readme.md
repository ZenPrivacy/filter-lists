RESIST. Reclaim your attention. Reclaim your life.

`no-doomscroll` is an opinionated set of filter lists for social media that remove feeds, recommendations, and other bits of UI whose only job is to keep you scrolling.

You can still open a profile, read a post, message a friend, or look something up.

Remove the endless stream you didn't ask for, and keep the parts of the web you actually came for.

## How to add

The filter lists are compatible with [Zen](https://github.com/ZenPrivacy/zen-desktop) and [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).
